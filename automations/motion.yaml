blueprint:
  name: Turn on light, switch, scene, script or group based on motion and illuminance.
  description: >
    Turn on a light, switch, scene, script or group based on motion detection, and low light level.

    This blueprint uses helper entities you have to create yourself for some input values, to be able to dynamically set limits. 
    For instructions on creating the helper entities take a look in the Home Assistant Community forum topic:
    https://community.home-assistant.io/t/turn-on-light-switch-scene-or-script-based-on-motion-and-illuminance-more-conditions/257085


    Required entities:
      - Motion sensor (binary_sensor in motion class)
      - Target entity (light, switch, scene or script)

    
    Optional features:

    - You can set a cutoff entity of which the value determines whether the illuminance level is low and the automation needs to trigger.
    - You can define a blocking entity, which blocks the automation from running when this entity's state is on.
    - You van define a turn-off blocking entity, which blocks the entity from turning off after the set delay.
    - Time limits can also be defined to limit the time before and after the automation should trigger.
    - If you want the entity to turn off after a certain amount of minutes, you can use the Wait Time input.
    - If you want another entity than the target_entity to turn off after the delay, you can define a separate Turn-off entity.
    - If you do not enable the optional entities the automation will skip these conditions.



    Optional entities:

    - Illuminance sensor (sensor in illuminance class)

    - Illuminance cutoff value  (input_number)
    
    - Blocking entity (any entity with state on/off)

    - Time limit before (input_datetime)

    - Time limit after (input_datetime)

    - Turn off wait time (input_number) - will not work with script or scene target entities.

    - Turn off entity (any entity_id)
